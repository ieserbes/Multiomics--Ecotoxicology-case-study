In this analysis, I used previously generated multiomics data (transcriptomics and metabolomics) of Daphnia magna , which exposed to different water samples collected from various sites of Danube River named from D1 to D12. 

The datasets contains:
LC-MS data indicating chemicals&concentrations in different Danube water sites D1 to D12.
LC-MS metabolomics data of Daphnia magna exposed to different water samples D1 to D12.
RNA-seq data of Daphnia magna exposed to different water samples D1 to D12.
Metadata information

Key analysis:
- Mapping orthogs of Daphnia magna to Homo sapiens
- Univariate transcriptomics analysis 
 -- Including network analysis with WGCNA
 -- DGEA with DESeq2 + GO enrichment
- Iterative Random Forest for metabolomics data
- Multiomics Data Analysis with MOFA2, and Enrichment Analysis

- Summary results can be found in Analysis_results.ppt file
